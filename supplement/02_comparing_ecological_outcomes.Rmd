# Comparing ecological outcomes across parameter combinations

![**Changes in population-level outcomes following pathogen introduction.** The introduction of the infectious pathogen leads to rapid evolutionary changes in movement strategies (see Figures 2 and 5; main text) across most combinations of landscape productivity and infection cost. In all combinations where there is rapid evolutionary shift in social-movement strategies, there is a similar change in the population's behavioural outcomes, with more movement and fewer associations. However, there is no change in per-capita intake. Each subplot in each panel shows the mean and standard error of the per-capita values for **(A)** distance moved, **(B)** intake, **(C)** number of associations, or encounters, with other individuals. Means and standard deviations are shown before (G = 3,000) and after (G = 3,500) pathogen introduction; each data point represents 10 replicates of the relevant parameter combination. In most cases, standard error is too small to be visible.](figures/fig_eco_compare_default.png)
